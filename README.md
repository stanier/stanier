## Yes hello you have found my GitHub readme thing.

I think I'm supposed to talk about myself here?

I don't like talking about myself.

## What do I do?

I am a junior HPC Linux Systems administrator.

## What does that mean?

I can google better than the average bear.

## What do you specialize in

* HPC
* Virtualization
* Admiring doorknobs
* Automation
* ~~Licking doorknobs~~ HR said I can't do this anymore

## What're all these repos that seem to be abandoned?

Those are old coding projects from high school.  We didn't really have STEM options where I grew up (thanks North Carolina Board of Education,) so instead I just coded whatever I could think of.  I may not have succeeded in my original goal with many of these projects, but I learned more than the public school system could ever teach me.

I don't really intend to revisit any of these projects, I just keep them up so I can cringe at my old code.  I guess you can look at it too, if you want to bleed from your eyeholes.

## Favorite programming/scripting languages

* Golang
* C++
* Vlang
* JavaScript
* Python
* Java
* The last one was a joke

## Favorite JS framework

* Angular2
* That's it, Angular2 was perfection.
* Seriously, they should have just stopped while they were ahead.
* React is a mere shadow of what Angular could have been, fight me.
