## Yes hello you have found my GitHub readme thing.

I think I'm supposed to talk about myself here?

I don't like talking about myself.

## What do I do?

I am an HPC Linux Systems administrator.

## What do I specialize in

* HPC
* Virtualization
* Automation
* Awkward attempts at sarcasm

## What interests me?

* Nature
* Surrealism
* Music
* Societal problems

## What're all these repos that seem to be abandoned?

Those are old coding projects from my middle/high school days.  They didn't have the resources to teach me code, so I taught myself through over-ambitious projects.

I don't really intend to revisit any of these projects, I just keep them up so I can cringe at my old code.  I guess you can look at it too, if you want to bleed from your eyeholes.

## What're you working on now?

You'll see, maybe...

## Favorite programming/scripting languages

* Golang
* C++
* Vlang
* JavaScript
* Python
* Java
* The last one was a joke

## Favorite JS framework

* Angular2
* That's it, Angular2 was perfection.
* Seriously, they should have just stopped while they were ahead.
* React is a mere shadow of what Angular could have been, fight me.
